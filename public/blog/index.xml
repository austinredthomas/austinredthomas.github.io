        &lt;p&gt;Truth is indifferent to your interests. It does not bend to convenience, nor does it care for your biases, expectations, or ideologies. It simply is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disinformation, on the other hand, is infinitely malleable. It can be shaped to affirm your prejudices, soothe your fears, or justify your desires. It is not bound by reality and, therefore, can be engineered for maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one truth — stubborn, singular, often inconvenient. But lies are legion. If one fails, another can take its place. And in a world where belief often trumps evidence, a single lie, well-crafted and well-timed, may be all that is required.&lt;/p&gt;
