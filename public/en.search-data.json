It does not bend to convenience, nor does it care for your biases, expectations, or ideologies. It simply is.\nDisinformation, on the other hand, is infinitely malleable. It can be shaped to affirm your prejudices, soothe your fears, or justify your desires. It is not bound by reality and, therefore, can be engineered for maximum effect.\nThere is only one truth — stubborn, singular, often inconvenient. But lies are legion. If one fails, another can take its place. And in a world where belief often trumps evidence, a single lie, well-crafted and well-timed, may be all that is required."},"title":"The assymetry of information warfare"},"/docs/":{"data":{"":"","hello-world#Hello, World!":"This is a demo of the theme’s documentation layout.\nHello, World! main.gopackage main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\") } "},"title":"Documentation"},"/docs/first-page/":{"data":{"":"A simple demo page."},"title":"Demo Page"},"/docs/folder/":{"data":{"":"Pages can be organized into folders."},"title":"Folder"},"/docs/folder/leaf/":{"data":{"":"This page is under a folder."},"title":"Leaf Page"},"/projects/":{"data":{"":"Here you will find a list of my projects and their respective documentation."},"title":"_index"}}
